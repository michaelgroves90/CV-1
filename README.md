## About Me

I am a Software Developer/Consultant living in Shropshire. Now with a years professional experience under my belt working as a Software Consultant for Capgemini SE, I am keen to start the next phase of my career and have an eye on accelerating my individual growth and furthering the knowledge and experience I have thus far attained. I am looking for an exciting new opportunity with a company that champions innovation and supports ambitious and creative engineers.

I have also spent many years working in the financial sector as a Collections Executive and AR Officer.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

During my time spent as an Audio Engineer and Music Producer I developed a very keen eye for recognising problems early and finding solutions fast.
This was then carried over into my work in Accounts where my eye for detail and experience with identifying problems left me in a good position at McLean Delmo Bentleys.
As their principal Collections Executive I streamlined and modernised their method of reporting aged client debt.
I have found my commitment to this skill in particular has been a considerable advantage for me whilst working as a software developer.

#### Communication/Diplomacy

Through my commitment to transparency and unique experience working with individuals from the financial world and the arts, I have cultivated a consistent ability to develop solid and lasting client relationships and a solid reputation for being someone people can rely on for honest and constructive contributions to my team.
During my time working for McLean Delmo Bentleys I had the difficult task of managing targets set by the CFO to collect aged debt whilst ensuring partner client relationships at the firm remained strong. This resulted in being placed often in the middle of any disputes and required a firm but open approach to diplomacy in resolving any conflicts.

#### Process

Agile Processes <br>
A firm commitment to Test Driven Development. <br>
CI/CD Pipeline and DevOps.
Project Planning: user stories, database structure and relationships, mock-ups.
Team Processes: pairing, mobbing, retros, check-ins.
Solid commitment to industry-standard best practices ensuring clean, efficient, readable code (Single Responsibility, DRY).

#### Public Speaking

I have always found public speaking to be something which came naturally to me, and which lead me to a brief stint in Theatre where I performed as the lead in a production of 'Hair' at the London Palladium. My time working as a vocalist in a touring band has also allowed me to further strengthen my confidence and ability to speak clearly and to engage with large groups of people.
